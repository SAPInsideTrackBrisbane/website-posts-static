# SITBNE Website Posts Static Content
For any posts that require to store static content you can use this public repository to store any content.  

Content can be referenced via the raw endpoint.  This is achieved by replacing the ```https://github.com/``` with ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/```

So
```
https://github.com/SAPInsideTrackBrisbane/website-posts-static/blob/main/posts/2018-02-22/images/abapgit_logo.svg
```

Would become 
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPInsideTrackBrisbane/website-posts-static/main/posts/2018-02-22/images/abapgit_logo.svg
```
